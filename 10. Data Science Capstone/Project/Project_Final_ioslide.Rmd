## Project Goal: The Next Word Predictor

### **What We Built**

* A **Shiny application** that predicts the next word in a sentence fragment.
* The model is built using **N-gram analysis** on massive text corpora.

### **Goal**
To demonstrate a practical application of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and text mining techniques.

## Data & Sources (1/2)

### **Corpus Sources (SwiftKey Dataset)**

The model is trained on three distinct English text sources:

* **Blogs (`en_US.blogs.txt`):** Casual, long-form content.
* **News (`en_US.news.txt`):** Formal, edited journalistic content.
* **Twitter (`en_US.twitter.txt`):** Short, informal, and often unedited snippets. (The data cleaning challenge!)

## Data & Sources (2/2)

### **Data Handling**

* The code manages the **download, unzip, and reading** of these large files.
* **Sampling:** A crucial step to balance performance and accuracy.

### **Bad Words Filtering**
* A dedicated list of offensive words (`bad_words`) is used. **You can filter this content** to keep the predictions clean.

## Algorithm 1: Back-off Method

### **Frequency-based Approach**

| Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Concept** | If a higher-order N-gram fails, the model **"backs off"** to the next lower order (e.g., 4-gram) until a match is found. |
| **Prediction** | Selects the word with the **highest raw frequency (count)** at the matched N-gram level. |
| **Pros** | Simple, fast, and effective for very common phrases. |
| **Cons** | Can be easily misled by infrequent but valid phrases. |



## Algorithm 2: Kneser-Ney Smoothing


### **The Smoothed Approach**

| Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
|**Concept** | A robust technique using **continuation probability**. It models how likely a word is to appear *in a new context*. |
|**Intuition** | It doesn't favor words that appear often in *one* specific context (like "San Francisco"). It rewards words that are versatile. |
|**Prediction** | Selects the word with the highest **smoothed (Kneser-Ney) score**, which generally improves accuracy on real-world, unseen text. |

## Using the App (1/3): Configuration

### **Configuration Steps: Data & Filters**
| # | Setting | Recommendation | Note |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | **Data Sources** | Blogs, News, & Twitter | Use all for the broadest training context. |
| 2 | **Sampling %** | **30%** | The best balance between size and training time. |
| 3 | **Stop Word Removal** | **Bad Words Only** (Default) | Keeps common words essential for N-gram context. |

## Using the App (2/3): Model & Training

### **Configuration Steps: Model & Training**

| # | Setting | Key Choice | Note |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| 4 | **Smoothing Method** | **Back-off** or **Kneser-Ney** | Choose performance vs. theoretical accuracy. (KN is usually superior.) |
| 5 | **Maximum N-gram** | **6-gram** (Fixed) | The highest context level we search. |
| 6 | **Train the Model** | Click the **"Generate N-grams (Train Model)"** button. | Wait until the **Model Status** shows **"✅ Model TRAINED!"** (Patience is key).
|

## Prediction in Action (3/3)

### **Input & Prediction**

| # | Setting | Key Choice | Note |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| 7 |  **Enter Sentence Fragment:** | Type your partial sentence. | *Example:* "Talking to your mom has the same effect as a hug and helps reduce your" |
| 8 | **Candidate Words (Optional):** | Restrict results (e.g., `stress, hunger, sleepiness`). | If blank, the Top 1000 unigram words are used. |
| 9 | Click **"Predict Next Word"**. | |

## **Output Analysis**

The result panel shows the prediction and the match source:

* **Prediction** (The suggested word).

* **Level** (e.g., `KN 5-gram` or `3-gram`).

* **Context Words** (The specific words used for the match).

* **Score** (Frequency or KN Term).

## Thank You!

This project successfully integrates big data handling, advanced NLP techniques, and a user-friendly Shiny interface.

### **A Note on KN:**
The Kneser-Ney implementation uses a simplified term for optimal app speed, balancing theoretical rigor with practical responsiveness.
